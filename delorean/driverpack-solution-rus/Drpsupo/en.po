This application analyses a user's computer and installs onto it the required drivers, which enables you to solve two issues: firstly, to speed up the process of the computer's configuration (which is especially important if there are dozens computers within one system); and secondly, to improve its operational ability."

msgid "landingPagePublications_secretfirmy"

msgid "landingPagePublications_cnews"

msgid "landingPagePublications_habr"
msgstr "The need to seek and install drivers each time when you reinstall Windows is, in my opinion, one of the most significant flaws of the entire Windows family. As far back as in 2008, I decided to fix this problem and wrote my own software which was called DriverPack. Today, my product is used by 40 million users all over the world, and I consider that the drivers problem in Windows has now been solved, albeit by means of a third-party solution."

msgstr "WannaCrypt blackmailer virus (spontaneously renamed WannaCry by the victims) attacked computers all over the world on May 12th, and infected the devices of more than 300,000 users in 150 countries. Western Europe, Russia, China were the worst hit. In Great Britain, the virus disabled the Health Department’s networks and halted the operation of hospitals all over the country. In China, the attack affected old computers at factories which halted several industries.<br/><br/>The main point of how this virus works is simple: it penetrates into your PC or laptop, and encodes absolutely all documents, files, and materials that it can find, and makes them unavailable for use. Then the intruders demand a substantial amount of money for decoding — about $300. However, there is no guarantee that you will get the access to your files back. At present, there is no way of decoding the files by yourself, and the solutions that are being offered on the Internet right now are either fishing, spreading another virus, or just don’t work with 100% certainty."

msgid "wannacryptpromopage_info-text-2"
msgstr "The PCs with operating system earlier than Windows 10 with open SMB ports are at the most risk. At present, half of all Windows users are at risk — 18% users use unlicensed Windows copies (automatically making them at risk), 23% users disabled their Windows Update service (which prevents them from downloading the latest &#147;hotfixes&#148; from Microsoft), and another 6% are using out-of-date OS versions which simply do not receive updates any more. <br/><br/>The conclusion from all this is that the networks of the various firms and enterprises who still use Operating Systems such as Windows XP are at the highest risk. In attacks on these networks, the data loss can be crippling and the cost will be enormous, as any &#147;ransom&#148; will have to be paid for each PC separately."
