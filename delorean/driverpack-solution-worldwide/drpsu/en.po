As far back as in 2008, I decided to fix this problem and wrote my own software which was called DriverPack.

msgstr "Bad Rabbit is a new cryptographic virus which has attacked computers in Russia, the Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Turkey since late October 2017. Also among the victims are The Interfax RIA, The Fontanka RIA, a number of Ministries of the Ukraine, as well as Odessa Airport. The principle of operation is simple: it uses the Mimikatz utility in order to retrieve the account data from your PC's memory. It also searches for the admin's active account data. Bad Rabbit then tries to gain access to the workstations in the local network by using SMB and WebDAV. As soon as it gets access to your PC, the virus encrypts all the data that it managed to reach, and after that it changes the Master Boot Record. When this procedure is complete, Bad Rabbit resets your computer and pops up its message with a demand for 0.05 Bitcoins (about $300 as of the end of October 2017)."

Western Europe, Russia, China were the worst hit. In Great Britain, the virus disabled the Health Department’s networks and halted the operation of hospitals all over the country. In China, the attack affected old computers at factories which halted several industries.<br/><br/>The main point of how this virus works is simple: it penetrates into your PC or laptop, and encodes absolutely all documents, files, and materials that it can find, and makes them unavailable for use. Then the intruders demand a substantial amount of money for decoding — about $300. However, there is no guarantee that you will get the access to your files back. At present, there is no way of decoding the files by yourself, and the solutions that are being offered on the Internet right now are either fishing, spreading another virus, or just don’t work with 100% certainty."

msgid "wannacryptpromopage_info-text-2"
msgstr "The PCs with operating system earlier than Windows 10 with open SMB ports are at the most risk. At present, half of all Windows users are at risk — 18% users use unlicensed Windows copies (automatically making them at risk), 23% users disabled their Windows Update service (which prevents them from downloading the latest \"hotfixes\" from Microsoft), and another 6% are using out-of-date OS versions which simply do not receive updates any more. <br/><br/>The conclusion from all this is that the networks of the various firms and enterprises who still use Operating Systems such as Windows XP are at the highest risk. In attacks on these networks, the data loss can be crippling and the cost will be enormous, as any \"ransom\" will have to be paid for each PC separately."
